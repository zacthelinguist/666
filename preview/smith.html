<h2>You Shook Me All Night Long</h2>
<p>by Zac Smith</p>

<p>The sun was out and the car had its windows down. You Shook Me All Night Long was playing, loud and dumb, while it idled at the light. Beside me were rocks, big ones, the size of soft balls. Decorative, useless stones. I grabbed one and hucked it hard. Direct hit on the windshield. It splintered, spiderwebbed, transforming from clear to opaque with one sad crunch. Nothing like in the movies. </p>

<p>The car alarm went off. The driver looked at me. Pure eye contact. </p>

<p> "What the fuck?" she yelled. </p>

<p>Someone else, too: "Hey, hey what the fuck?" He had sunglasses, felt like getting involved, felt like getting a new story to tell. Maybe he wanted to feel alive like me. </p>

<p>I was alive. I was alive and I was flipping them both the bird. Two hands, two fingers.</p>

<p> "Eat shit," I said. </p>

<p>He came over with his hands up like <i>hey now, hey now</i>, while Tracie shut off the car. AC/DC stopped. Finally, finally, that <i>fucking</i> song. The street was quiet and normal and I wasnâ€™t, not at all, I was moving, breathing, putting my fists up. I stood, ready to punch, ready to put my weight behind it. Really, really put my weight into it. </p>

<p>The guy in the sunglasses stepped back. Flinched. I saw the flinch. Tracie kept shouting, kept asking what the fuck.  What the fuck, what the fuck. No one knew what the fuck. I kept moving, breathing. Hot glare on the sunglasses. </p>

<p>When I was in tenth grade, I woke up one day and the entire world was different. My entire brain was new and awash in the realization that I had been wasting weeks, months, years on trying to be a good person, to be safe, to be kind, to be responsible and respectful, to go to school, to plan for my future, to love my family and myself. Etcetera. But that day, the truth was revealed to me, and I felt shame. I felt a horrible embarrassment for having ever felt any different than I felt just then. I woke up ready to cut my classes, ditch my friends, and find out about every party hosted by every piece of shit football player because <i>I needed to find someone to fuck.</i> I skulked, evaluating my odds with people I had never even looked at twice before, ignoring everyone and everything else, drifting home to eat and watch porn and masturbate, in a frenzy, over and over again, angry and insane with my new idiot brain, obsessing with the idea of true biological need, a deep, unruly longing for intimacy, for penetration, for skin colliding with skin and breath colliding with breath. And the next morning, I was back to my old, normal, boring self. As if nothing had happened at all. And I grew up, lived a normal, boring, well-tempered existence. Until Tracie. Until after Tracie. Until now. </p>

<p>There I was, that old, angry thing inside me, let out into the day. </p>

<p>Maybe I was actually two people. One of me was like a hinge with a now rusty nail, or a screen door with a terminally long run in it. And Tracie was the humid air that begat the rust, the careless jab that punctured the screen. And whoever I was deep down was the dog who had caught sight of an injured squirrel, ready to sink its teeth, shake its head, snap the neck. </p>

<p>Whoever I was then had come back. Picked up a rock, started something irreversible. </p>

<p>And the guy with the stupid fucking sunglasses was the squirrel. </p>

<p>And I fucking hated AC/DC. </p>

<p>I punched him good. Felt pain somewhere far off in my fist. Rethinking my entire life and coming up with nothing good. Nothing good at all. AC/DC could go fuck themselves. Tracie could go fuck herself. Sunglasses dude could go fuck himself. I swung and I swung and he went down hard, those stupid, stupid fucking sunglasses still on his dumb fucking face. </p>
