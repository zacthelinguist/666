<h2>The Hereafter</h2>
<p>by Cavin Gonzalez</p>


<p>Mist leaked from fading stars as the boy drudged through grey snow toward his bus stop. The dark blue light and bludgeoning coldness of the morning wore on him as he marched toward a lone street lamp. In the darkness, the boy can hear other children on other streets shuffling and shoving and laughing. Nobody ever took his road. Not ever. Not even cars. His was the only house on the dirt road and really it was only a shack with two cots and a wood stove and a sick old woman that struggled to get soup into his mouth during the dead winter months.</p>
<p>The boy stepped. Snow crunched. This rhythm was torture. Existing here was torture. It wasn't natural. His breath intertwined with the mist and bled into the creeping morning, danced into the forest bordering the sidewalk on both sides. The boy had been going to school for eternity. He spent decades of preparing stale cheese sandwiches for lunch, epoch’s learning cursive and colors and how to spell the word ‘<i>tattered</i>’. Pine trees reached for his shoulders and gnarled roots caught his ankles. The forest was always trying to beckon him but he stayed straight every day, eyes fixed ahead at the street lamp. He never strayed. Not once.</p>
<p> "You don’t belong in those woods," his grandmother with the black eyes had told him once, "but it thinks you do. It will try to take you away from your new home. It wants to keep you prisoner."</p>
<p>Everything before the shack and his grandmother and perpetual schooling is a mist, too. There are silhouettes there but they don't have names or faces and they’re naked, basking in emptiness. When the boy thinks about it very hard, he remembers a light unlike the one he knows here. It's yellow and bright and warm and makes the hair on his arms stand up and applaud. The light here is damp. It’s only ever black or blue. For how long had the boy been here?</p>
<p>The street lamp is very close to the boy now. He knows that a silent bus will soon roll up and he will get on it and glide past the faceless driver. Phantom children will spit balls of paper at him and laugh at his pulse. At school, the boy will hear the same lesson that's taught every day. He'll go home and his grandmother who isn’t really his grandmother will stroke his hair and sing him a song in a dead language that makes the boy feel safe and sound.</p>
<p>The boy stands beneath the street lamp and stares into the woods in front of him. He has always wanted to touch the pine needles, to climb up and up and up until he can see where he really was. If he had a sense of direction, maybe the boy could get home. Maybe he could stop relying on the sick soup and the stale bread of that old woman’s home and he can go back to where he’s supposed to be, to where he was before he was here, wherever that may be. And as the boy stared into the brush he noticed a twitch, as faint as it was, and recoiled behind the lamp. From there he watched as a tiny thing crept forward, closer and closer until it was standing right in front of the lamp, just beyond the border of pine trees. A kitten stared up at the boy. It was the only animal he had seen since he woke up in the old woman’s apple orchard.</p>
<p>The kitten was somehow more black than the surrounding sky. Its two eyes were white, blind, but fixed perfectly on the boy. When he reached down to pat its head, dozens of blind eyes cracked open across the kitten's body, glowing faintly. He scratched its head and the kitten purred. He smiled for the first time in eternity. The kitten turned and pranced into the forest. The boy followed. </p>
