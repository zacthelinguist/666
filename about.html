<h2>About</h2>
<p>666 Lit is a weekly, online journal literary fiction. We publish strange, dark, impressionistic, and scenic flash fiction. 666 is a word count, an anchor point, a mood -- but also: Hail Satan.</p>

<h2>Submit</h2>
<p>Please send all submissions as an attached .doc/.docx/.rtf file or directly in the body of an e-mail to <b>sixsixsixlit@gmail.com</b> and mention "submission" and/or Satan in your subject line. Include a brief cover letter and 3rd person bio.</p>

<p>666 words. Nothing else. We will make line edits/typo fixes as needed. If you send 667 words, we will cut one. If you send 665 words, we will add one. 666 is the deal. No genre fiction, no poetry, no essays. One piece at a time. Withdraw if yr accepted elsewhere. Wait a month before submitting again, win or lose.</p>

<p>We reserve North America first-publication rights only. Please acknowledge us in all future publications of your piece. We will of course nominate you for prizes, are you kidding? Sheesh.</p>

<p>666 Lit is a supporter of #SaferLit. We don't publish anything shitty, so don't send your racism, homophobia, transphobia, sexual violence, or any other kind of entitled republican garbage.</p>
